# JNI Bind

![Ubuntu Build](https://github.com/google/jni-bind/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

`JNI Bind` is a new metaprogramming library that provides syntactic sugar for `C++` => `Java/Kotlin`.  It is header only and provides sophisticated type conversion with compile time validation of method calls and field accesses.

It requires clang enabled at C++17 or later, is compatible with Android, and is unit / E2E tested on `x86`/`ARM` toolchains.

**Many** features and optimisations are included:

- **Object Management**
- **Compile time method name and argument checking**
- **Static caching of IDs** *multi-threading support and compile time signature generation.*
- **Classes** *native construction, argument validation, lifetime support, method and field support.*
- **Classloaders** *native construction, object "buildability".*
- **JVM Management** *single-process multiple JVM lifecycles.*
- **Strings** *easy syntax for inline argument construction.*
- **Arrays** *inline object construction for method arguments, efficient pinning of existing spans.*
- And *much* more!

Curious to try it? Check out the [Godbolt sample](https://godbolt.org/z/6dfs43MK5)!

If you're enjoying JNI Bind, or just want to support it, please consider adding a GitHub ⭐️!

## Quick Intro

**JNI is notoriously difficult to use, and numerous libraries exist to try to reduce this complexity**. These libraries usually require code generation (or extensive macro use) which leads to brittle implementation, indexes poorly, and still requires domain expertise in JNI (making code difficult to maintain).

**`JNI Bind` is header only (no auto-generation), and it generates robust, easily maintained, and expressive code.** It obeys the regular RAII idioms of C++17 and can help separate JNI symbols in compilation. Classes are provided in `static constexpr` definitions which can be shared across different implementations enabling code re-use.

This is a sample  Java class and it's corresponding`JNI Bind` class definition:

```java
package com.project;
public class Clazz {
 int Foo(float f, String s) {...}
}
```

```cpp
#include "jni_bind_release.h"

static constexpr jni::Class kClass {
  "com/project/clazz", jni::Method { "Foo", jni::Return<jint>{}, jni::Params<jfloat, jstring>{}},

jni::LocalObject<kClass> obj { jobject_to_wrap };
obj("Foo", 1.5f, "argString");
// obj("Bar", 1.5, "argString");  // won't compile (good).
```

There are [sample tests](javatests/com/jnibind/test/) which can be a good way to see some example code.  Consider starting with with [context_test_jni](javatests/com/jnibind/test/context_test_jni.cc), [object_test_helper_jni.h](/javatests/com/jnibind/test/object_test_helper_jni.h) and [ContextTest.java](javatests/com/jnibind/test/ContextTest.java).

<a name="installation-without-bazel"></a>
## Installation *without Bazel*

If you want to jump right in, copy [jni_bind_release.h](jni_bind_release.h) into your own project.  The header itself is an automatically generated "flattened" version of the Bazel dependency set, so this documentation is a simpler introduction to `JNI Bind` than reading the header directly.

You are responsible for ensuring `#include <jni.h>` compiles when you include `JNI Bind`.

<a name="installation-with-bazel"></a>
## Installation *with Bazel*

If you're already using Bazel add the following to your WORKSPACE:

```starlark
http_archive(
  name = "jni-bind",
  urls = ["https://github.com/google/jni-bind/archive/refs/tags/Release-0.9.9-alpha.zip"],
  strip_prefix = "jni-bind-Release-0.9.9-alpha",
)
```

Then include `@jni-bind//:jni_bind` (not `:jni_bind_release`) and `#include "jni_bind.h"`.

JNI is sometimes difficult to get working in Bazel, so if you don't have an environment already also add this to your `WORKSPACE`, and follow the pattern of the BUILD target below.

```starlark
# Rules Jvm.
RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG = "4.2"
RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA = "cd1a77b7b02e8e008439ca76fd34f5b07aecb8c752961f9640dea15e9e5ba1ca"

http_archive(
    name = "rules_jvm_external",
    strip_prefix = "rules_jvm_external-%s" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
    sha256 = RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA,
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/archive/%s.zip" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
)
```

```starlark
cc_library(
    name = "Foo",
    hdrs = [
        "jni_bind_release.h",
    ],
    srcs = [
        "Foo.cc",
        "@local_jdk//:jni_header",
        "@local_jdk//:jni_md_header-linux",
    ],
    includes = [
        "external/local_jdk/include",
        "external/local_jdk/include/linux",
    ],
)
```
There are easy to lift samples in [javatests/com/jnibind/test/](javatests/com/jnibind/test/). If you want try building these samples (or to copy the BUILD configuration) you can clone *this* repo.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/google/jni-bind.git
cd jni-bind
bazel test  --cxxopt='-std=c++17' --repo_env=CC=clang ...
```

<a name="usage"></a>
# Usage

<a name="jvm-lifecycle"></a>
## JVM Lifecycle
**JNI Bind requires some minor bookkeeping in order to ensure acccess to a valid `JNIEnv*`**. To do this, create a [`jni::JvmRef`](implementation/jvm_ref.h) whose lifetime extends past any JNI Bind call (*a function local static is a reasonable way to do this, although sanitizers will flag this as a memory leak, so all tests explicitly manage the lifetime of the `jni::jvmRef`).

The simplest way to from the `JavaVM*` in your `JNI_OnLoad` call. **This object's lifetime must outlive all JNI calls.**

```cpp
JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM* pjvm, void* reserved) {
  static auto jvm{std::make_unique<jni::JvmRef<jni::kDefaultJvm>>(pjvm)};
  return JNI_VERSION_1_6;
}
```
:warning: If you using another JNI Library initialise `JNI Bind` after. `JNI Bind` "attaches" the thread explicitly through JNI, and some libraries behaviour will be conditional on this being unset.  If JNI Bind discovers a thread has been attached previously it will not attempt to tear the thread down on teardown.

You can also build a `jni::jvmRef` from any `JNIEnv*`.

<a name="classes"></a>
## Classes

Class definitions are the basic mechanism by which you interact with Java through JNI:

```cpp
static constexpr jni::Class kClass{"com/full/class/name/JavaClassName", jni::Field..., jni::Method... };
```

jni::Class definitions are static (the class names of any Java object is known in advance).  Instances of these classes are created at runtime using [`jni::LocalObject`](implementation/local_object.h) or [`jni::GlobalObject`](implementation/global_object.h).

<a name="local-and-global-objects"></a>
## Local and Global Objects

Local and global objects manage lifetimes of underlying `jobjects` using the normal RAII mechanism of C++. **`jni::LocalObject` always fall off scope at the conclusion of the surrounding JNI call and are valid only to a single thread, however `jni::GlobalObject` may be held indefinitely and are thread safe**.

`jni::LocalObject` is built by either wrapping a `jobject` passed to native JNI from Java, or constructing a new object from native (see [Constructors](constructors)).

When `jni::LocalObject` or `jni::GlobalObject` falls off scope, it will unpin the underlying `jobject`, making it available for garbage collection by the JVM.  If you want to to prevent this, call `Release()`. This is useful to return a `jobject` back from native, or to simply pass to another native component that isn't JNI Bind aware.  Calling methods for a released object is undefined.

When possible try to avoid using raw `jobject`. Managing lifetimes with regular JNI is difficult, e.g. `jobject` can mean either local or global object (the former will be automatically unpinned at the end of the JNI call, but the latter won't and must be deleted _exactly_ once).

Because `jobject` does not uniquely identify its underlying storage, it is presumed to always be local.  If you want to build a global, you must use either `jni::PromoteToGlobal` or `jni::AdoptGlobal`. e.g.

```cpp
jobject obj1, obj2, obj3;
jni::LocalObject local_obj {obj1}; // Fine, given local semantics.
// jni::GlobalObject global_obj {obj2}; // Illegal, obj2 could be local or global.
jni::GlobalObject global_obj_1 {PromoteToGlobal{}, obj2}; // obj2 will be promoted.
jni::GlobalObject global_obj_2 {AdoptGlobal{}, obj3}; // obj3 will *not* be promoted.
```
  When using a jobject you may add `NewRef{}` which creates a new local reference, or `AdoptLocal{}` which takes full ownership.

*Because JNI objects passed to native should never be deleted, `NewRef` is used by default (so that `LocalObject` may always call delete).  A non-deleting `FastLocal` that does not delete may be added in the future.  In general you shouldn't need to worry about this.*


[Sample C++](javatests/com/jnibind/test/context_test_jni.cc), [Sample Java](javatests/com/jnibind/test/ContextTest.java)

<a name="method-definitions"></a>
## Methods

**A `jni::Method` is described as a method name, a `jni::Return`, and an optional `jni::Params` containing a variadic pack of zero values of the desired type.** If a class definition contains `jni::Method`s in its definition then corresponding objects constructed will be imbued with `operator()`. Using this operator with the corresponding method name will invoke the corresponding method.

```cpp
static constexpr jni::Class kClass {
   "com/project/kClass",
   jni::Method{"intMethod", jni::Return{jint{}},
   jni::Method {"floatMethod", jni::Return{jfloat{}}, jni::Params{ jint{}, jfloat{} }},
   jni::Method {"classMethod", jni::Return{kClassFromOtherHeader} }
};

jni::LocalObject<kClass> runtime_object{jobj};
int int_val = runtime_object("intMethod");
float float_val = runtime_object("floatMethod");
jni::LocalObject<kClassFromOtherHeader> class_val { runtime_object("classMethod") };
```

Methods will follow the rules laid out in [Type Conversion Rules](#type-conversion-rules). *Invalid method names won't compile, and `jmethodID`s are cached on your behalf. Method lookups are compile time, there is no hash lookup cost.*

[Sample C++](javatests/com/jnibind/test/method_test_jni.cc), [Sample Java](javatests/com/jnibind/test/MethodTest.java)

<a name="fields"></a>
## Fields

**A `jni::Field` is described as a field name and a zero value of the underlying type.** If a class definition contains `jni::Fields` in its definition then corresponding objects constructed will be imbued with `operator[]`. Using this operator with the corresponding field name will provide a proxy object with two methods `Get` and `Set`.

```cpp
static constexpr jni::Class kClass {
  "kClassName",
  jni::Field {"intField", jint{} },
};

jni::LocalObject<kClass> runtime_object{jobj};
runtime_object["intField"].Set(5);
runtime_object["intField"].Get(); // = 5;
```

Accessing and setting fields will follow the rules laid out in [Type Conversion Rules](#type-conversion-rules). *Accessing invalid field names won't compile, and `jfieldID`s are cached on your behalf.*

[Sample C++](javatests/com/jnibind/test/field_test_jni.cc), [Sample Java](javatests/com/jnibind/test/FieldTest.java)

<a name="constructors"></a>
## Constructors

If you want to create a new Java object from native code, you can define a `jni::Constructor`, or use the default constructor. **If you omit a constructor the default constructor is called, but if any are specified you must explicitly define a no argument constructor.**

```cpp
static constexpr jni::Class kSomeClass{...};

static constexpr jni::Class kClass {
   "com/google/Class",
   jni::Constructor{jint{}, kSomeClass},
   jni::Constructor{jint{}},
   jni::Constructor{},
};

jni::LocalObject<kClass> obj1{123, jni::LocalObject<kSomeClass>{}};
jni::LocalObject<kClass> obj2{123};
jni::LocalObject<kClass> obj3{};  // Compiles only because of jni::Constructor{}.
```

Constructors follow the arguments rules laid out in [Type Conversion Rules](#type-conversion-rules).

[Sample C++](javatests/com/jnibind/test/object_test_helper_jni.h).

<a name="type-conversion-rules"></a>
## Type Conversion Rules

All JNI types have corresponding `JNI Bind` types. These types are used differently depending on their context.  Sometimes multiple types are valid as an argument, and you can use them interchangeably, however *types are strictly enforced, so you can't pass arguments that might otherwise implictly cast*.

| JNI C API    | Jni Bind Declaration         | Types valid when used as arg                      | Return Type                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| void         |                              |                                                   |                                                |
| jboolean     | jboolean                     | jboolean, bool                                    | jint                                           |
| jint         | jint                         | jint, int                                         | jint                                           |
| jfloat       | jfloat, float                | jfloat                                            | jfloat                                         |
| jdouble      | jdouble, double              | jdouble                                           | jdouble                                        |
| jlong        | jlong, long                  | jlong                                             | jlong                                          |
| jobject      | jni::Class kClass            | jobject, jni::LocalObject, jni::GlobalObject[^1]  | jni::LocalObject<kClass>                       |
| jstring      | jstring                      | jstring, jni::LocalString, jni::GlobalString,     | jni::LocalString                               |
|              |                              | char*, std::string                                |                                                |
| jarray       | jni::Array<T>                | jarray, jni::LocalArray, , jlongArray             | jni::LocalArray<T>                             |
|              |                              | jbooleanArray, jbyteArray, jcharArray,            |                                                |
|              |                              | jfloatArray, jintArray                            |                                                |
| jobjectarray | jni::Array<jobject, kClass>  | jarray, jni::LocalArray<jobject, kClass>,         | jni::LocalArray<T>                             |

More conversions will be added later and this table will be updated as they are. In particular `wchar` views into jstrings will offer a zero copy view into java strings.  Also, `jarray` will support `std::span` views for its underlying types.

[^1]:Note, if you pass a `jni::LocalObject` or `jni::GlobalObject`as an rvalue, it will release the underlying jobject (mimicking the same rules used for [const& in C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lifetime)).

<a name="advanced-usage"></a>
# Advanced Usage

<a name="strings"></a>
## Strings

Strings are slightly atypical as they are a regular Java class ([java/lang/String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)) but have a separate JNI type, `jstring`. They therefore have two separate `JNI Bind` types: `jni::LocalString` and `jni::GlobalString`.

Unlike `jni::LocalObject`, you must explicitly pin the underlying string data to access it (arrays also follow this paradigm). To "view" into the string, you must call `Pin()` which returns a `jni::UtfStringView`.  You can call `ToString()` to get a `std::string_view` into the string.

```cpp
jni::LocalString new_string{"TestString"};             // builds a new java/lang/String instance.
jni::UtfStringView utf_string_view = new_string.Pin();
std::string_view jni_string_view = utf_string_view.ToString();
```

`jni::UtfStringView `will immediately pin memory associated with the jstring, and release on leaving scope. This will *always* make an expensive copy, as strings are natively represented in Java as Unicode (C++20 will offer a compatible `std::string_view` but C++17 does not).

[Sample C++](javatests/com/jnibind/test/string_test_jni.cc), [Sample Java](javatests/com/jnibind/test/StringTest.java)

<a name="forward-class-declarations"></a>
## Forward Class Declarations

Sometimes you need to reference a class that doesn't yet have a corresponding JNI Bind definition (possibly due to a circular dependency or self reference). This can be obviated by defining the class inline.

```cpp
using ::jni::Class;
using ::jni::Constructor;
using ::jni::Return;
using ::jni::Method;
using ::jni::Params;

static constexpr Class kClass {
  "com/project/kClass",
  Method{"returnsNothing", Return<void>{}, Params{Class{"kClass2"}},
  Method{"returnsKClass", Return{Class{"com/project/kClass"}},           // self referential
  Method{"returnsKClass2", Return{Class{"com/project/kClass2"}},         // undefined
};

static constexpr Class kClass2 {
  "com/project/kClass2",
  Constructor{ Class{"com/project/kClass2"} },  // self referential
  Method{"Foo", Return<void>{}}
};

LocalObject<kClass> obj1{};
obj1("returnsNothing", LocalObject<kClass2>{});        // correctly forces kClass2 for arg
LocalObject<kClass> obj2{ obj1("returnsKClass") };     // correctly forces kClass for return
LocalObject shallow_obj{} = obj1("returnsKClass");     // returns unusable but name safe kClass
// shallow_obj("Foo");                                 // this won't compile as it's only a forward decl
LocalObject<kClass> rich_obj{std::move(shallow_obj)};  // promotes the object to a usable version
LocalObject<kClass2> { obj1("returnsKClass2") };       // materialised from a temporary shallow rvalue

```
Note, if you use the output of a forward declaration, it will result in a *shallow* object. You can use this object in calls to other methods or constructors and they will validate as expected.

Sample: [proxy_test.cc](implementation/proxy_test.cc).

<a name="multi-threading"></a>
## Multhreading

When using multi-threaded code in native, it's important to remember the difference between maintaining thread safety in your native code vs your Java code. `JNI Bind` *only* handles thread safety of your native handles and class ids.  E.g. you might safely pass a `jobject` from one native thread to another (i.e. you managed to get the handle correctly to the other thread), however, your Java code may not be expecting calls from multiple threads.

**To pass a jobject from one thread to another you must use `jni::GlobalObject`** (using `jni::LocalObject` is undefined).

Upon spinning a new native thread (that isn't the main thread), you must declare a `jni::ThreadGuard` to explicitly announce to JNI the existence of this thread.  It's permissible to to have nested `jni::ThreadGuard`s.

Sample [jvm_test.cc](implementation/jvm_test.cc).

<a name="overloads"></a>
## Overloads

Methods can be overloaded just like in regular Java by declaring a name, and then a variadic pack of [`jni::Overload`](implementation/method.h). Overloaded methods are invoked like regular methods. `JNI Bind` will correctly differentiate between functions that differ only by type, including functions that take different class types.

```cpp
static constexpr Class kClass{
    "com/google/SupportsStrings",
    Method{
        "Foo",
        Overload{jni::Return<void>{}, Params{jint{}}},
        Overload{jni::Return<void>{}, Params{jstring{}}},
        Overload{jni::Return<void>{}, Params{jstring{}, jstring{}}},
    }
};

LocalObject<kClass> obj{};
obj("Foo", 1);
obj("Foo", "arg");
obj("Foo", "arg", jstring{nullptr});
```

Sample [method_test_jni.cc](javatests/com/jnibind/test/method_test_jni.cc), [MethodTest.java](javatests/com/jnibind/test/MethodTest.java).

<a name="class-loaders"></a>
## Class Loaders

Class loaders are a powerful but complex tool that enable loading class definitions at runtime from classes not present in the primordial loader.  Their scope is well in excess of this documentation, but you will need a solid understanding of their usage to deploy them successfully (check out the reference links).

To define a class loaded class, you must first define a [`ClassLoader`](https://github.com/google/jni-bind/blob/75225652d1f88140770ae2368ca9d60e390680ed/implementation/class_loader.h):
```cpp
static constexpr ClassLoader kTestClassLoader{
    kDefaultClassLoader, SupportedClassSet{kClassLoaderHelperClass}};
```

The first argument is the "parent" loader, which can be either `kDefaultClassLoader`, `kNullClassLoader` or a different `ClassLoader` instance you have defined.
I recommend reading [Baeldung's "Class loaders in Java"](https://www.baeldung.com/java-classloaders), but, a rough explanation is that the [`DefaultLoader`](https://github.com/google/jni-bind/blob/75225652d1f88140770ae2368ca9d60e390680ed/implementation/default_class_loader.h) supports everything, the [`NullLoader`](https://github.com/google/jni-bind/blob/75225652d1f88140770ae2368ca9d60e390680ed/implementation/default_class_loader.h#L77) will support nothing, and a custom loader will support its own classes. When building classes using a loader, your hierarchy will be searched from base to parent searching for the first viable loader.

The second argument is the `SupportedClassSet`, a set of all classes this loader will directly support building. It is acceptable to support building the same class at multiple layers in your loader hierarchy.

To build objects with a `ClassLoader` you create a [`LocalClassLoader`](https://github.com/google/jni-bind/blob/75225652d1f88140770ae2368ca9d60e390680ed/implementation/local_class_loader.h#L38) or [`GlobalClassLoader`](implementation/global_class_loader.h) instance. Unfortunately, these currently must be constructed in Java [like in the sample](https://github.com/google/jni-bind/blob/75225652d1f88140770ae2368ca9d60e390680ed/javatests/com/jnibind/test/ClassLoaderTest.java#L80) (this is deficiency of JNI Bind, feel free to file a bug if you actually need this from native).

```cpp
LocalClassLoader<kTestClassLoader> class_loader{jclass_loader_obj};
jni::LocalObject<kClassLoaderHelperClass, kTestClassLoader> = class_loader.BuildLocalObject<kClassLoaderHelperClass>();
```

:warning: *You* must add the `kTestClassLoader` above, JNI Bind incorrectly does not enforce this, but it will be a compilation error in the future, and failing to do so may cause crashes.

Classloaders support building their own instances of classes, and if they can't build it themselves, they will defer to their parents. JNI Bind will validate any class you attempt to build by traversing its hierarchy and resolving to the base most loader available (or the primordial loader if no custom loader is found). Note that the constructor set of the class will be respected, so pass these arguments to `Build[Local|Global]Object` as if you constructed the object directly.

You can now use this object as usual. This additional decoration may seem excessive, however, this is actually required, because objects of different class loaders are not interchangeable, and they require completely independent class and method lookups.

Sample [class_loader_test_jni.cc](javatests/com/jnibind/test/class_loader_test_jni.cc), [ClassLoaderTest.java](https://github.com/google/jni-bind/blob/75225652d1f88140770ae2368ca9d60e390680ed/javatests/com/jnibind/test/ClassLoaderTest.java#L80).

<a name="statics"></a>
## Statics

Statics are declared as an instance of [`jni::Static`](implementation/static.h) which is constructed with [`jni::Method`](implementation/method.h) and jni::Field instances (in that order). Unlike regular objects, you make the static invocation with `StaticRef`.

```cpp
static constexpr Class kSomeClass{"com/google/SomeClass"};

static constexpr Class kClass{
  "com/google/HasStaticMethods",
  Static {
    Method { "staticTakesInt", Return{}, Params<int>{}  },
    Method { "staticTakesFloat", Return{}, Params<float>{} },
    Field { "staticLongField", jlong{} },
    Field { "staticObjectField", kSomeClass },
  },
  // Some other field (comes after).
  Field { "Foo", jint{}, }
};

StaticRef<kClass>{}("staticTakesInt", 123);
StaticRef<kClass>{}("staticTakesFloat", 123.f);
StaticRef<kClass>{}["staticLongField"].Set(123);
StaticRef<kClass>{}["staticObjectField"].Set(LocalObject<kSomeClass>{});
```

Statics will follow the rules laid out in [Type Conversion Rules](#type-conversion-rules). *Invalid static method names won't compile, and `jmethodID`s are cached on your behalf. Static method lookups are compile time, there is no hash lookup cost.*

<a name="arrays"></a>
## Arrays

Java arrays can be defined in JNI Bind and offer similar mechanics as you would expect with other types.

[`jni:Array<type, possible_class_definition>`](implementation/array.h) provides the static definition, which is referenced by [`LocalArray<type, possible_class_definition>`](implementation/local_array.h) which provides [`Get`/`Set`](implementation/array_ref.h) methods, or [`ArrayView`](implementation/array_ref.h) via `Pin(bool copy_on_completion=true)`. [`ArrayView`](implementation/array_ref.h) has a `ptr()` method which itself can be used to modify underlying values (to be copied back out when `ArrayView` falls off scope).

```cpp
LocalArray<jint> arr{3}; // {0, 0, 0}
// LocalArray<jint> int_arr{1,2,3}; // coming soon
LocalArray<jint> another_valid_arr {some_jarray_val};

{
  // Value is written when it falls off scope
  ArrayView view = arr.Pin(/*copy_on_completion=true*/);
  view.ptr()[0] = 123;
}

// You can also use helper methods Set/Get.
arr.Get(0); // 123
arr.Set(1, 456);

```

If `copy_on_completion` is `false`, values will *not* be copied back when the scope of `ArrayView` falls off scope (otherwise it will). This can be used as an optimisation when you only intend to read from the array.

Arrays can be used in conjunction with fields and methods as you would expect:

```cpp
  static constexpr Class kClass{
    "com/google/SupportsStrings",
    Method{ "Foo", Array{int{}} },
    Field { "intArrayField", Array<int>{} },
    // , Field { "intArrayArrayField", Array{ Array { int{} } }  // coming soon
};

LocalObject<kClass> obj{};
LocalArray<int> arr = obj["intArrayField"];
```

Arrays can be used in conjunction with primitive types or classes, but if they are used with classes they will always consist of `LocalObjects` (reasoning about a `LocalArray` with a `GlobalObject` is too confusing).

```cpp
static constexpr Class kClass{
    "com/google/SupportsStrings",
    Field { "objectArrayField", Array<jobject, kClass>{} }
};

LocalArray<jint> int_arr{1,2,3};

// Arrays work just like any other type in JNI Bind.
obj("Foo", 1);
obj("Foo", "arg");
obj("Foo", "arg", jstring{nullptr});
```

`LocalArray` has two constructors, one for construction from an existing `jarray` object (similar to `LocalObject`) and another that builds a new array full of zero initialised objects. For primitives, simply indicate the size, for object arrays, provide a default object that will be used to fill the array.

```cpp
    LocalArray<int> local_int_array{3};
    LocalArray<jobject, kClass> local_obj_array{5, LocalObject<kClass>{}};
```

*Arrays of arrays, while legal, are not currently supported. They will be supported in the future.*

Sample [local_array.h](implementation/local_array_test.cc), [array_test_jni.cc](javatests/com/jnibind/test/array_test_jni.cc), [ArrayTest.java](javatests/com/jnibind/test/ArrayTest.java).

<a name="upcoming-features"></a>
## Upcoming Features

Feature requests are welcome! Some upcoming features are:

- Statics
- Tighter array type validation (arrays are overly permissive for arguments)
- Better error messages
- Link time symbol validation in Bazel
- Unit Testing Support (enabling unit testing of JNI interfaces)
- Callback syntactic sugar
- Per JNI call lambda invocations (e.g. per JNI call logging, perf tracing)
- Auto generated interfaces (with pre-loaded scrapes of Java libraries)
- And more!
