** WARNING **

Class definitions in this directory may have their path change in the future, you may be better suited creating copies until full scrapes of APIs are provided in the future.

These are used to bootstrap JNI Bind, but may change in the future, and may also be superseded by separate more complete definitions.

Some definitions in this directory exist solely for phase 1 compilation and as such may be incomplete.
